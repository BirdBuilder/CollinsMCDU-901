*** Raspberry Pi-based External FMC CDU for XPlane ***

This is the software to accompany my 737 FMC CDU project. Details of the project can be found
on my blog here: http://blog.shahada.abubakar.net/tag/737fmccdu.

==================A word from the "modder"============================================
 This package is a modification of the original version by Shahada for use with
 a Rockwell Collins MCDU-901. I do not claim to have created this software nor
 do I intend to distribute the modified package. The likelyhood of this
 modified version being compatable with anything other than the "901" is zero.
 The sole purpose of the modification is to allow the MCDU-901's key matrix to
 work with the software. Tim.P 10/4/21

BUILDING FROM SOURCE
- I suggest just using the prebuilt packages (see below).
- If you really want to build from source, hunt down the dependencies, then do a "make" followed by "sudo make install"

•	Flash Raspbian Lite
•	Connect it to wifi
•	sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get --yes upgrade
•	sudo apt-get install wiringpi (because wiringpi wont be found)
•	sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer (because font LiberationSans.ttf wont be found)
•	sudo apt install git (this was so you can “git clone”)
•	wget -O- http://repo.shahada.abubakar.net/pubkey.asc | sudo apt-key add –
•	cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
•	sudo wget http://repo.shahada.abubakar.net/repo.shahada.abubakar.net.sources.list
•	sudo apt-get update
•	sudo apt-get install libsdl2-rpifb libsdl2-rpifb-dev libsdl2-rpifb-ttf libsdl2-rpifb-ttf-dev
•	sudo apt-get install libxplane-extplane-client0 libxplane-extplane-client0-bin libxplane-extplane-client0-dev
•	git clone https://github.com/yourrepository/yourFMS (Download your version from github)
•	cd yourFMS
•	make
•	sudo make install

 

PREBUILT PACKAGE QUICK INSTALLATION

Prebuilt .deb binaries are available for raspbian "Stretch". 
See http://blog.shahada.abubakar.net/post/installing-pixplanefmccdu-software for more details.

- Install the repository public key:
  wget -O- http://repo.shahada.abubakar.net/pubkey.asc | sudo apt-key add -
  
- Add the APT source:
  cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
  sudo wget http://repo.shahada.abubakar.net/repo.shahada.abubakar.net.sources.list
  
- Install the binaries:
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install pi-xplane-fmc-cdu
  
The software can be updated to the latest version at any time by executing:
  sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade


TESTING

- Two test programs are currently available:

  testFMCLED
  - This is a command line test program to test the functionality of the LEDs. 

  testFMCkeypad
  - This is a command line test program to test the functionality of the keypad.


USAGE

  - The main application is started by executing "piXPlaneFMCCDU".
	
  - Read the Installation Guide to have the software start automatically when the Pi is powered on.
